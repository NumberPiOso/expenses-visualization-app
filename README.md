# Expenses

I plan to create a expenses visualization web application for personal use.
I think I will do it using FastAPI and Postgresql at backend, besides that,
may god help me.



**Tasks to do (in priority order)**
- [X] Sample expenses backend api
- [] Create models and connect it to the database
- [] Create simple frontend
- [] Deploy
